This dataset was created by capturing video clips of ships navigating through the Wuhan section of the Yangtze River, specifically the Zhuozhou Yangtze River Bridge, the Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge, and the Second Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge. 
From these video clips, one frame image was extracted every 50 frames, resulting in a total of 983 ship images after removing highly similar images. These images were added to the existing Seaships dataset, resulting in an expanded dataset called Seaships_enlarge.
